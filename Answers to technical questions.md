1.	How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

    I spent 3 hours on the technical test. If I had more time, there are a few things I would add. For this particular feature, I would add more compatibility testings. I only used Google Chrome in this technical test, but I would cover different browsers including Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc. Also, I would cover more operating systems, including mobile devices, rather than only in Windows 10. 


2.	What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?

    Continuous testing is becoming a very interesting and important way to do automation testing. it makes testing efficient and engaged earlier than usual. In this way, more automation test cases will be executed in order to improve the quality of the software. 

3.	How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?

    Even though I have not done any legacy application, I would start by analyzing the application, like what functions are most essential, what part of the application is used more frequently, any test case is hard for humans but easy for a computer, etc. Make a list by priority and choose automation tools and frameworks accordingly.


4.	How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?

 * When a user tries to enter the postcode, it is nice to have a function that could detect the current location of the user and automatically enter into the postcode filed. 

* It would be very convenient for the user if the website could show restaurants on a map, so the user could know how far are they.
